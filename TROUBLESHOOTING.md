# RP Video Suite - Troubleshooting & Next Steps

## Current White Screen Issue

The application is experiencing a white screen error after the most recent deployment. This typically indicates a JavaScript runtime error that prevents the React application from rendering. The issue occurred after implementing comprehensive error handling and project loading improvements.

## Debugging Steps

To resolve the white screen issue, the following diagnostic approach should be taken. First, check the browser console for JavaScript errors, which will provide specific information about what is failing during application initialization. Common causes include missing imports, undefined variables, or circular dependencies.

Second, verify that all required dependencies are properly installed and that the build process completes without errors. The build logs should be examined for any warnings or errors that might indicate compilation issues.

Third, test the application in development mode using `pnpm run dev` to see if the issue persists in the development environment. Development mode often provides more detailed error messages and better debugging capabilities.

## Known Working State

The last known working version included the following features functioning correctly: expandable module layout, Final Image Assets with native aspect ratios, Key Frames with 3-window creation system, drag-and-drop functionality between modules, and the + button integration for sending images to crop windows.

The application was successfully displaying all eight modules in expanded state, allowing for comprehensive testing of the complete workflow from image upload through storyboard creation.

## Immediate Recovery Plan

The fastest path to recovery involves reverting to the last known working commit and then reapplying changes incrementally. This approach allows for identification of the specific change that introduced the white screen error.

Start by checking out the previous working commit, then verify that the application loads correctly. Once confirmed, begin reapplying the recent changes one at a time, testing after each change to identify the problematic modification.

## Component-Specific Issues

Several components have been recently modified and should be examined for potential issues. The FinalImageAssets component received extensive error handling updates that might have introduced syntax errors or logical issues. The Dashboard component was modified to auto-load the default project, which could be causing initialization problems.

The KeyFrames component had significant updates to the drag-and-drop functionality and error handling. Any of these modifications could be the source of the runtime error causing the white screen.

## Development Environment Setup

For continued development, ensure that the development environment includes Node.js version 22.13.0, pnpm package manager, and all required dependencies installed. The development server should be accessible on localhost with proper hot reloading functionality.

Environment variables must be properly configured, particularly the Vertex AI API key and any Firebase configuration. Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause initialization failures that result in white screen errors.

## Testing Strategy

Once the white screen issue is resolved, implement a systematic testing approach for future changes. This should include testing each module individually, verifying drag-and-drop functionality between modules, confirming that the + button workflow operates correctly, and ensuring that project loading and state management work as expected.

Automated testing should be considered for critical functionality to prevent regression issues. Unit tests for individual components and integration tests for cross-module interactions would provide confidence in future deployments.

## Next Development Priorities

After resolving the current issue, the development priorities should focus on completing the AI integration features. The Banana Fill functionality needs full implementation with actual AI generation calls. The video generation pipeline requires completion with proper integration to the Vertex AI services.

Export functionality should be implemented to allow users to download their completed projects in various formats. Performance optimization should be addressed, particularly for handling large image files and multiple simultaneous operations.

## Long-term Enhancements

Future development should consider user authentication and project sharing capabilities. Cloud storage integration would allow for project synchronization across devices. Advanced AI features could include style transfer, automated editing suggestions, and intelligent content analysis.

Mobile optimization should be enhanced to provide a fully functional experience on tablets and smartphones. Accessibility improvements would make the application usable by a broader range of photographers and creative professionals.

## Deployment Improvements

The deployment process should include automated testing to catch issues before they reach production. Staging environments would allow for thorough testing of changes before deployment to the live application.

Monitoring and logging should be implemented to provide real-time insight into application performance and user issues. This would enable faster identification and resolution of problems like the current white screen error.

## Documentation Maintenance

As development continues, documentation should be kept current with all changes and new features. User guides should be created to help photographers understand the complete workflow from initial image upload through final video export.

Technical documentation should include API references, component documentation, and deployment procedures. This ensures that future developers can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

## Support and Maintenance

A support system should be established for handling user issues and feature requests. Regular maintenance schedules should include dependency updates, security patches, and performance optimizations.

Backup and recovery procedures should be documented and tested to ensure that user projects and application data are protected against loss or corruption.
