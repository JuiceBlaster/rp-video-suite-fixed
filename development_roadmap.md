# Agentic Development Roadmap for RP Video Suite

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive, agentic development roadmap for the RP Video Suite application. The proposed strategy leverages a multi-platform AI approach, integrating OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve rapid, cost-effective, and autonomous development, testing, deployment, and iteration. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and AI-powered web application that transforms photographers' still images into cinematic video narratives.

## 2. Optimal Agentic Development Architecture

The proposed architecture is designed to facilitate a seamless and automated development workflow, with clear separation of concerns and a robust orchestration layer. The following diagram illustrates the key components and their interactions:

### Key Components:

*   **User Interaction:** The developer or user interacts with the project through a GitHub repository, which serves as the single source of truth for the application code and development tasks.
*   **Orchestration:** GitHub Actions, triggered by events in the repository, run an orchestrator script that reads and executes tasks defined in `TASKS_P0.yaml`. This script is the central nervous system of the agentic workflow.
*   **MCP Tool Servers:** A suite of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers provide a standardized interface for the orchestrator to interact with various AI and cloud services. This includes dedicated servers for GitHub, Firebase, Vertex AI, and OpenAI Codex.
*   **AI & Cloud Services:** The MCP servers interact with the underlying APIs of GitHub, Firebase, Vertex AI (Gemini, Imagen, Veo), and OpenAI (Codex) to perform development tasks.
*   **Deployment:** The application is deployed to Firebase App Hosting, with the entire process managed through the agentic workflow.

## 3. Implementation Plan

The implementation plan is broken down into a series of tasks, defined in the `TASKS_P0.yaml` file. This task graph ensures a logical and dependency-aware execution of the development process. The following table provides a high-level overview of the key implementation phases:

| Task ID | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| T001 | Set up Firebase project and enable required GCP services | Create a new Firebase project and enable Firestore, Storage, Functions, and Vertex AI APIs. |
| T002 | Initialize GitHub repository with branch protection and secrets | Create a new GitHub repository, set up branch protection rules for main, and add necessary secrets for Firebase and GCP. |
| T003 | Scaffold the React + TypeScript + Vite frontend application | Use Vite to create a new React application with TypeScript and set up the basic project structure. |
| T004 | Install frontend dependencies and configure TailwindCSS | Install necessary npm packages for state management, routing, and UI components, and configure TailwindCSS. |
| T005 | Implement core UI modules (Modules 1-3) | Develop the React components for the Photographer Manifesto, Project Foundation, and Final Image Assets modules. |
| T006 | Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for Firebase Hosting | Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and deploy the React application to Firebase Hosting. |
| T007 | Implement Storyboard and Key Frame modules (Modules 4-6) | Develop the React components for Key Frames, Key Frame Storyboard, and Approved Storyboard modules. |
| T008 | Implement Video Key Frames and Scene Builder modules (Modules 7-8) | Develop the React components for Video Key Frames and Scene Builder modules. |
| T009 | Develop Firebase Functions for AI service integration | Create and deploy Firebase Functions to act as a secure proxy for Vertex AI API calls. |
| T010 | Integrate AI services into the frontend application | Connect the frontend components to the Firebase Functions to enable AI-powered features like storyboard and video generation. |
| T011 | Final deployment and end-to-end testing | Deploy the complete application and perform end-to-end testing of all features. |

## 4. Next Steps

To initiate the agentic development process, the following steps should be taken:

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository:** This will serve as the home for the RP Video Suite project.
2.  **Commit the provided files:** The `project_analysis.md`, `ai_platforms_research.md`, `agentic_architecture.mmd`, `agentic_architecture.png`, `TASKS_P0.yaml`, and this `development_roadmap.md` file should be committed to the repository.
3.  **Configure GitHub secrets:** Add the necessary secrets for Firebase and GCP to the GitHub repository settings. This will allow the GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with these services.
4.  **Trigger the first GitHub Actions workflow:** Manually trigger the initial workflow to kick off the agentic development process. The orchestrator will then take over and begin executing the tasks defined in `TASKS_P0.yaml`.

By following this roadmap, you can leverage the power of multiple AI platforms to build, test, deploy, and iterate the RP Video Suite application in a fully agentic and cost-effective manner. This approach will not only accelerate the development process but also ensure a high-quality, scalable, and feature-rich final product.
